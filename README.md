A simple watch face that includes 4 complication fields and a persistent battery indicator. 

Basically this watch face is based on the Android sample code and designed for a round watch.

The app is written in Kotlin, a new first class programming language for Android. You can say this is a playground of my study about Kotlin and Android Wear. Technically I just add those features I need here.

The app is also available in Google Play.
